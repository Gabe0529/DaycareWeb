            Our story began in 2015, caring for our own children — never imagining it would grow into something bigger. The joy we brought to the children, 
            and the kind words from other parents, inspired us to open our hearts and home to more families. By 2019, we had earned the trust of our community and expanded our space to 
            welcome even more little ones. Then came 2021 — a time when the pandemic and housing crisis made us fear everything we had worked for might slip away. But with perseverance, faith, 
            and the incredible support of a government grant, we turned our struggle into hope, moving into a larger home and creating the warm, welcoming daycare we had always dreamed of. Today, 
            every laugh, every smile, and every milestone reminds us why we never gave up.

        </div>

        <p> I seek to project myself as a program that leads training processes aimed at the social development 
            of the child, taking into account their individual differences where intellectual, spiritual people are formed; 
            with principles and values that make an integral human being.
            I guarantee a complete and comprehensive system for families and their children, which starts at birth 
            up to 5 years of age, to provide a unique opportunity for children to enter school ready to learn and succeed in life.

                    My name is Blanca Jara, and I have been dedicated to teaching children for over 23 years. My experience spans from working as a school teacher to leading infant programs, 
                    teaching high school students, and now proudly serving as a daycare owner for the past 10 years. I am EEC Director II certified, hold a Bachelor’s degree in Elementary 
                    Education, and an Early Childhood Certificate. I deeply value culture and am passionate about creating a positive impact in every child’s journey by providing them with 
                    a safe, nurturing environment — a true second home away from home."

                <p>
                    I’m Luz Adriana Otálvaro Pineda, an EEC Certified Assistant at Family Child Care. I have a degree in Business Administration and I’m continuing my studies at QCC to gain more knowledge. I have taken two classes: Child Growth and Development and Family Issues.
                    I’m grateful to God for giving me the opportunity to do this job, which I truly love. Being surrounded by children has given me the empathy to relate to each of them and has helped me develop a greater sensitivity to their individual needs.
                    I have two years of experience in this wonderful field. This time has been much more than a job—it has been a journey of mutual learning and a constant source of joy. Working with such fragile little people, who are waiting to receive love, tenderness, respect, and attention, has been a deeply rewarding experience.
