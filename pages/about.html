            Our Story
        </h1>
       <h2>
            2015 - The Beggining
       </h2> 
       <p>
            This here is where it all started with taking care of our own childern, with good reviews and constant smiles we began making an impact in the daycare scene.
       </p>

        <h2>
            2019 - Moving Up
       </h2> 
       <p>
            As we expanded our certificates, we had to expand to our home to house more children and give out more smiles. 
       </p>
        <h2>
            2021 - A Helping Hand
       </h2> 

       <p>
            Due to the pandemic and the housing crisis things were not looking good, as after all the hard work we had put in, we worried about how much more we had to keep fighting, but that struggle 
            did not go in vain as we got the break we needed with a helping hand from a government grant, we were able not only to move out to a bigger place but remodel it to the daycare we once only dreamed of     .
